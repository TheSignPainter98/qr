# `qr`

An ultra-simple QR-code generator.

Tired of ‘free’ online services inexplicably needing access to personal data just to generate QR codes?
Perplexed by websites gating access to a free format behind a paywall?
Enough of that, just do it locally with `qr`.

# Usage

Run—

```bash
qr 'beepboop'
```

And you will see a file called `qr.png` containing a QR code with content `beepboop`.

For more options, run—

```bash
qr --help
```

# Installation

Run the following steps—

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheSignPainter98/qr
cargo install --path qr
```

The `qr` command is now installed.
